                Overview Of The Placer County Water Agency
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) was created through an Act of
                the California State Legislature in 1957. PCWA’s jurisdiction
                encompasses the entire County of Placer, and it is governed by
                an elected five-member Board of Directors.

                History of PCWA Energy and Water Development - Development of
                the Middle Fork American River Project:
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                The immediate objective for the formation of the Agency was to
                preserve Placer County’s rich water resources for our future
                generations and protect these local benefits from development
                and exportation by other interests, as was occurring elsewhere
                in the state. It was at this time that San Francisco, Oakland,
                Los Angeles, and the federal and state governments, were
                building reservoirs in water-rich areas of California and
                aqueducts to move that water to supply new farmlands and growing
                coastal cities.

                A bond measure to fund construction of the proposed Middle Fork
                American River Hydroelectric Project (MFP), backed by a 50-year
                PG&E contract for the energy output, passed by a vote of 25 to 1
                and within 10 years of its formation, PCWA completed
                construction. The MFP’s reservoirs can store up to 340,000
                acre-feet of water and its generators produce an average of 1.1
                million megawatt hours of energy per year - enough clean energy
                to supply 240,000 homes.

                The Gold Rush Water Supply:
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                By 1855, just 7 years after gold was discovered at Sutter’s
                Mill, miners had built over 175 miles of canals in Placer County
                to provide the water needed for hydraulic mining. But hydraulic
                mining was soon outlawed and by 1910, PG&E had purchased the
                system that brought water from the South Fork Yuba River across
                western Placer County and began installing hydroelectric
                generators to power a new system of electrification.
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                PG&E also found a growing market supplying water to west Placer
                agriculture. Because of its developed water supply, Placer
                County was the richest agricultural producing county in the
                state in the 1920-40s, supplying fresh fruit to New York over
                the continental railroad.
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                Gradually there was growing recognition that communities needed
                to treat their drinking water to prevent disease. The earliest
                systems, which consisted of settling ponds and chlorination,
                using PG&E supplied water, were installed by Lincoln and
                Roseville to supply their cities’ residents. By the late 1940s,
                PG&E built more modern filtered water systems to supply its
                retail customers in Rocklin, Loomis, Penryn, and Auburn.

              <Type variant="h4">PCWA Takes Over the PG&E Water System:</Type>
              <Type>
                The 1950-60s brought growing mutual dissatisfaction between PG&E
                and its water customers. PG&E was far more interested in its
                profitable energy businesses, while increasing water safety
                regulations were adding costs and liability to their water
                enterprises. PG&E decided it wanted out of the retail water
                business, and PCWA was asked by the community to take over the
                responsibility.
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                In August 1967, a special election within PCWA’s newly formed
                Zone 1 to authorize the sale of $2 million in revenue bonds for
                the purchase of PG&E’s water system passed with 65% of the vote.
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                Then in 1975, the voters in Zone 1 authorized additional debt of
                $6 million to fund the construction of the Foothill Water
                Treatment Plant (WTP) along with transmission lines that
                permitted the Agency to interconnect the Foothill WTP with the
                existing Sunset WTP, to extend wholesale treated water service
                to the City of Lincoln, and to decommission Lincoln’s pond
                treatment system and outdated water treatment plants in Penryn,
                Loomis and Rocklin.

              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                PCWA is the largest water purveyor in the county, serving more
                than 41,000 retail treated water customers in its Western Water
                System, which includes the original Zone 1 and extends east from
                Auburn to the communities of Applegate, Colfax, and Alta. PCWA
                continues to provide treated water on a wholesale basis to the
                City of Lincoln – a service it has also extended to California
                American Water Company for delivery west of Roseville, and to
                several historic community systems in the Loomis Basin. In
                addition, PCWA supplies water from its MFP to the City of
                Roseville and San Juan Water District, which operate their own
                treatment facilities. And PCWA continues to operate 165 miles of
                canals, serving irrigation water for pastures, orchards, rice
                fields, farms, ranches, golf courses, and landscaping –
                continuing the heritage of Placer County’s historic water
                delivery.

              <Type paragraph>
                PCWA’s MFP is the eighth largest public power project in
                California. It has five interconnected hydroelectric power
                plants, two major storage reservoirs (French Meadows and Hell
                Hole) and twenty-four miles of tunnels. The MFP can generate, at
                peak power, 224 megawatts.
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                The MFP is a workhorse of the real time California energy
                management system. The California Independent System Operator
                uses the flexible generation capacity of the MFP to help
                regulate grid frequency as electric demand and solar output
                changes throughout the day. And revenue from MFP generation
                enables PCWA to supply reliable American River water to Placer
                County residents at low cost.
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                The MFP also supports a wide range of recreational opportunities
                including camping, fishing and boating facilities at our
                mountain reservoirs, and whitewater sports downstream of the
                project.

                Stewardship:
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                The old cliché, “Whisky’s for drinking, and water’s for
                fighting” is still true today. Southern California exhausted its
                available water supply over 20 years ago. Since then they have
                relied on stringent conservation requirements and expensive
                recycling programs to continue to meet the water needs of new
                development. In contrast, PCWA still has sufficient reserved
                water supplies in its MFP system to meet all of the county’s
                projected growth in demand for the next 30 years. This disparity
                in supply makes protecting Placer County’s resources
                challenging.
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                Challenges include drought and increasing state-wide water
                conservation requirements; climate change, with rising sea
                levels threatening delta ecosystems and the proposed twin delta
                tunnels to move Southern California intakes upstream and
                increase water exports; new state-wide groundwater
                sustainability requirements; and a proposed water tax to improve
                water to disadvantaged San Joaquin Valley communities. The list
                of real-time water issues in California today that threaten our
                finances and local water supply reliability are significant, and
                growing.
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                Plus, we have real needs right here in Placer County, where
                several small mountain communities are struggling to keep water
                supplies safe, reliable and affordable.
              </Type>
              <Type paragraph>
                PCWA officials understand the complexities, interrelationships
                and importance of sustaining reliable and affordable water and
                energy for Placer County’s present and future needs. The Agency
                is actively involved in numerous collaborative partnerships,
                watershed stewardship, surface and groundwater management,
                integrated water resource planning, and regional infrastructure
                projects. Advocacy for Agency water entitlements and energy
                resources for Placer County are at the forefront of Agency-wide
                interests and activities.
