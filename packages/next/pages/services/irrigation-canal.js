      PCWA's primary source of water is delivered through canals operated by
      Pacific Gas & Electric Company's (PG&E). After the irrigation season
      (October/November), PG&E shuts down various canals for routine
      maintenance. This annual maintenance affects delivery to PCWA customers.
      During this time, PCWA schedules irrigation canal outages and spreads
      remaining water supplies to mitigate the impact on its customers.
