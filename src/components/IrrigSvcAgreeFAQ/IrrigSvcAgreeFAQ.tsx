              PCWA requires all untreated water customers to sign an untreated
              water application. Following recent updates to the Agency's Rules
              & Regulations related to untreated water service, PCWA updated its
              agreement. Customers must sign the updated agreement for continued
              untreated water deliveries. The agreement includes important
              changes that customers need to be aware of as a condition of
              service.

            What are my options if I need to make a private repair to an

              All leaks on private property are the responsibility of the
              customer. To assist, PCWA may temporarily suspend service for up
              to 48 hours to allow the customer to install an isolation valve
              between the Agencyâ€™s delivery point and the private delivery point
              or a shared delivery point. The customer can either complete the
              repair in 48 hours or install an isolation valve within the
              48-hour time period. Staff recommends that customers install a
              valve in the event more time is needed to complete the repair. The
              Agency does not temporarily suspend service for other private side
              issues.

              Yes. It is the customer's responsibility to provide safe access to
              the Agency's facilities within the customer's property at all
              reasonable times, and in the event of an emergency. If access is
              restricted, the customer will be notified to correct the
              condition(s) within 14 days. Failure to address the access issues
              within 14 days will result in remediation of the condition by
              Agency crews, to be billed to the customer on a time and materials
              basis, and/or termination of service, at the Agency's sole
              discretion.

            Are there any changes for customers on a party line?

              While customers on existing party lines are not required to make
              any changes, they now have the option to form an association and
              consolidate billing to one account. In doing so, the association
              becomes PCWA's customer, not the individual parcel owners.
              Additionally, should existing party lines want to increase their
              deliveries to accommodate requests from adjacent parcels there
              must (1) be capacity on the PCWA canal and the PCWA pipeline
              serving the customer(s), and (2) an isolation valve must be
              installed after the Agency's canal turnout, with the ability to
              isolate the entire party line. The increase in deliveries will be
              reflected on the bills of existing party line customers or through
              a single point of contact in the case of newly formed association.
            </Type>
            <Type variant="body2" paragraph>
              For new party lines, the Agency will only authorize the
              installation of one canal turnout and the customers on that party
              line will be required to setup one account (i.e. association) as
              the PCWA customer. Isolation valves are required on all new
              untreated water connections.
            </Type>
            <Type variant="body2" paragraph>
              The same requirements for new party lines applies to lot splits.
              The landowner would have to install an isolation valve after the
              Agency's canal turnout, and setup one account (for all lots) as
              the PCWA customer.
